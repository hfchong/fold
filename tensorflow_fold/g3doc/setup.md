# Download and Setup

Fold has been updated to work with the latest version of TensorFlow (v1.12.0-rc2). You need to build build TensorFlow
and Fold from source. Refer to [Dockerfile](https://github.com/datagovsg/tensorflow-sentiment-tutorial/blob/master/docker/tensorflow_v1.12.0-rc2_fold/Dockerfile.gpu) 
for steps on how to build from source. If you are running TensorFlow and Fold via the Docker image, you will need [nvidia-docker2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) 
package. If you are running NVIDIA GTX 1070, you will need NVIDIA driver version>=410.XX.
